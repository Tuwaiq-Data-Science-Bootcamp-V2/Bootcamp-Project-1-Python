# Bootcamp project 1
This project is a simple Python program that allows the user to order food items from a menu, add them to a cart, and calculate the total cost of their order. The menu is represented as a dictionary, with each item in the menu having a name and a price. The program will display the menu to the user, prompt them to make a choice, and add the choice to the cart. The user can continue to make choices or quit the program. When the user quits the program, it will display the items in the cart along with the total cost. The program uses various functionalities like input, dictionary, while loop and lambda function to make the program interactive, readable and efficient.
